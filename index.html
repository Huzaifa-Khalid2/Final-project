    <h1> Riddle fun</h1>

     <p>Let's play a game, you will get two riddles and you must solve and enter the two answers below in the text boxes and then click the check results button to view your results (<b> SPELLING MISTAKES WILL COUNT AS AN ERROR PLEASE DON'T MAKE SPELLING MISTAKES</b>)  for the <b>first</b> riddle the answer is hidden in the words written under the buttons if you're able to find it that is... or if you recognize this riddle then... lucky you I guess. If you are not able to find the asnwer using the words below don't get fusturated just click the button which says <b>extra hint</b> which will give you a hint. Since I don't want to make the game too easy I <b>won't</b> be giving you a clue or hint for the <b>second</b> riddle you must find that one on you're own. </p>
    
    <h3> How it works</h3>
    
    <p> If you get both answers correct you get 100/100 if you get both wrong or chose to not guess both then you get 0/100 and if you get one right and chose to write nothing for the other or get the other wrong well... I regret to inform you but this is an all or nothing situation you either get 100/100 or 0/100 so if you put one wrong answer or one blank then I am afraid it will be a 0/100</p>
